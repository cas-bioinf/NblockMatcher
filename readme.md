# NblockMatcher
Find sequence motif combinations according to custom specification.

The motif search itself is currently made by `FIMO` from `MEME suite`.

### Basic description:
Given motif combination, the script will find all motifs individually with `FIMO` and then filter them, so their reported
 combinations follows the given criteria (order, strand, distance).
The score of the combined motif satisfying given criteria is taken as a sum of the scores. The p-value for the combined 
 motif can be optionally computed with `pytfmpval` package (separate installation is needed at this moment).
